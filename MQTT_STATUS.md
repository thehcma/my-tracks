# MQTT Implementation Status

**Last Updated**: February 20, 2026

## Overview

Implementing embedded MQTT broker for OwnTracks bidirectional communication.

**Goals**:
- Battery life improvement (MQTT vs HTTP polling)
- Bidirectional communication (send commands to devices)
- Real-time location updates

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Broker ✅
- **PR #100** - amqtt dependency (MERGED)
- Added `amqtt` from git (Python 3.14 compatible)
- Created `MQTTBroker` class wrapper

### Phase 2: Message Handlers ✅
- **PR #101** - Location processing (MERGED)
- `OwnTracksMessageHandler` for parsing messages
- Topic parsing: `owntracks/{user}/{device}`
- Extract location, LWT, transition data

### Phase 3: Authentication ✅
- **PR #102** - Django user integration (MERGED)
- `DjangoAuthPlugin` for amqtt
- Topic-based ACL (users can only access their own topics)
- Uses `sync_to_async` for Django ORM in async context

### Phase 4: Command API ✅
- **PR #103** - REST API for commands (MERGED)
- `Command` class with factory methods
- `CommandPublisher` for MQTT publishing
- REST endpoints:
  - `POST /api/commands/report-location/`
  - `POST /api/commands/set-waypoints/`
  - `POST /api/commands/clear-waypoints/`

### Phase 5.1: Server Integration ✅
- **PR #104** - MQTT broker startup (MERGED)
- `--mqtt-port` flag (default: 1883, 0 = OS allocates, -1 = disabled)
- `--http-port` flag (renamed from `--port`)
- Runtime config via JSON file (`config/.runtime-config.json`)
- OS-allocated port discovery via `actual_mqtt_port` property
- ASGI lifespan handler starts/stops broker

## Phase 5: Integration (IN PROGRESS)

### Tasks:
1. ~~**Server integration**~~ ✅ (PR #104)

2. ~~**Admin UI MQTT endpoint display**~~ ✅ (PR #105)
   - Show HTTP/MQTT status in web UI with consistent format
   - Display MQTT host and port for OwnTracks app configuration
   - Updated OwnTracks setup instructions for both MQTT and HTTP modes

3. ~~**Wire message handlers**~~ ✅
   - Connect `OwnTracksMessageHandler` to broker via amqtt plugin
   - Process incoming location messages → save to database
   - Broadcast to WebSocket clients via channel layer
   - Created `OwnTracksPlugin` with `on_broker_message_received` hook

4. ~~**Graceful process termination**~~ ✅
   - `graceful_kill()` function: SIGTERM first, configurable wait, SIGKILL fallback
   - Uses signal names (TERM, KILL) instead of numbers
   - Applied to server PID, orphaned HTTP, and orphaned MQTT processes

5. ~~**Traffic generator MQTT support**~~ ✅ (PR #126)
   - Added `--mqtt` flag to `generate-tail` traffic generator
   - `MQTTTransport` class wrapping `amqtt.client.MQTTClient`
   - Auto-detects MQTT port from server's runtime config
   - `--mqtt-host`, `--mqtt-port`, `--mqtt-user`, `--mqtt-password` options
   - 38 new tests in `test_generate_tail.py`

6. ~~**LWT handling**~~ ✅ (PR #128)
   - Added `is_online` field to Device model
   - `save_lwt_to_db()` marks device offline, stores LWT payload
   - `save_location_to_db()` marks device online when location received
   - Real-time WebSocket broadcast of device status changes
   - Admin UI shows online/offline status with filtering

7. **Historic view date & time picker** ← NEXT
   - Replace time range `<select>` with date picker + dual-handle time slider
   - Date picker (`<input type="date">`) to select any past day (default: today)
   - noUiSlider dual-handle range (0:00–24:00) to select time window within day
   - Live time labels update as handles are dragged
   - API already supports `start_date` + `end_date` (no backend changes needed)

8. **Transition events**
   - Handle region enter/exit events
   - Store transition history

9. **Waypoints sync**
   - Connect waypoint storage to command API
   - Allow UI to send waypoints to devices

## Test Coverage

- 310 tests passing
- 90.67% code coverage
- All pyright checks pass

## Technical Notes

- **Python 3.14 compatibility**: amqtt installed from git, not PyPI
- **Django ORM in async**: Use `sync_to_async` wrapper
- **SQLite async tests**: Use `@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)`

## Next Steps

Phase 5 (Integration) is ready to begin. All prerequisite PRs are merged.

## Future Enhancements

- **MQTT over TLS** - Add `--mqtt-tls-port` (8883) for encrypted connections
