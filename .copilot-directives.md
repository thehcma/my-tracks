# Copilot Agent Directives

**Important**: These directives must be followed for all work on this project.

## Server Management

### Always Use start_server Script

**CRITICAL**: When starting the Django development server, ALWAYS use the `start_server` script:

```bash
./start_server
```

**Never use** `python manage.py runserver` directly. The `start_server` script ensures:
- Virtual environment is activated
- Port 8080 is used consistently  
- `uv` is in PATH
- Proper error handling
- We continuously test the script itself

**Rationale**: By always using the `start_server` script, we ensure it stays working and catches any issues with the setup process.

## Package Management

- **ONLY use `uv`** for Python package management
- Install dependencies: `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`
- Never use `pip` directly

## Script Convention

### Shell Scripts
- All shell scripts MUST be created **without the `.sh` extension**
- Examples: `setup`, `start_server`, `deploy` (not `setup.sh`, `start_server.sh`, etc.)
- Make executable: `chmod +x scriptname`
- Use shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`

### Python Scripts
- All standalone Python scripts MUST be created **without the `.py` extension**
- Examples: `generate_load`, `migrate_data` (not `generate_load.py`, `migrate_data.py`)
- Make executable: `chmod +x scriptname`
- Use shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Rationale: Cleaner command-line interface, consistent with Unix conventions

## Development Workflow

Before any PR creation, ensure:
1. Implementation Agent completes changes
2. Primary Critique Agent (Claude) reviews
3. Secondary Critique Agent (GPT-5) reviews independently
4. Testing Agent ensures comprehensive coverage
5. VS Code Problems panel is clear (no errors)
6. Tests run without warnings
7. All agents confirm approval

## Testing

- Always run tests before committing: `pytest`
- Achieve 90%+ code coverage
- Include randomized tests for all implementations
