# My Tracks — Implementation Plan

**Last Updated**: February 28, 2026

## Overview

Evolution plan for My Tracks, a self-hosted location tracking backend for the OwnTracks Android/iOS app.

**Core Goals**:
- Persist and visualize geolocation data
- Battery-efficient real-time updates via embedded MQTT broker
- Bidirectional device communication (send commands to devices)
- User authentication and TLS certificate management

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Basic MQTT Broker ✅
- **PR #100** - amqtt dependency (MERGED)
- Added `amqtt` from git (Python 3.14 compatible)
- Created `MQTTBroker` class wrapper

### Phase 2: Message Handlers ✅
- **PR #101** - Location processing (MERGED)
- `OwnTracksMessageHandler` for parsing messages
- Topic parsing: `owntracks/{user}/{device}`
- Extract location, LWT, transition data

### Phase 3: Authentication ✅
- **PR #102** - Django user integration (MERGED)
- `DjangoAuthPlugin` for amqtt
- Topic-based ACL (users can only access their own topics)
- Uses `sync_to_async` for Django ORM in async context

### Phase 4: Command API ✅
- **PR #103** - REST API for commands (MERGED)
- `Command` class with factory methods
- `CommandPublisher` for MQTT publishing
- REST endpoints:
  - `POST /api/commands/report-location/`

  - `POST /api/commands/clear-waypoints/`

### Phase 5: Integration ✅

1. **Server integration** ✅ (PR #104)
   - `--mqtt-port` flag (default: 1883, 0 = OS allocates, -1 = disabled)

3. **Wire message handlers** ✅
   - Connect `OwnTracksMessageHandler` to broker via amqtt plugin
   - Process incoming location messages → save to database
   - Broadcast to WebSocket clients via channel layer
   - Created `OwnTracksPlugin` with `on_broker_message_received` hook

4. **Graceful process termination** ✅
   - `graceful_kill()` function: SIGTERM first, configurable wait, SIGKILL fallback

## Upcoming Work

### Phase 6, Step 4: MQTT Broker TLS Integration ← NEXT
Full TLS integration: server certificate presentation + client certificate authentication + CRL enforcement.

- **Server-side TLS**
  - MQTT broker reads active server cert from database at startup
  - `--mqtt-tls-port` flag (default: 8883, -1 = disabled)
  - Broker presents server certificate for TLS connections
  - Write cert/key to temporary files for amqtt TLS configuration
  - Display TLS status and port in web UI (About & Setup page)
  - OwnTracks setup instructions updated for TLS mode

- **Client certificate authentication**
  - MQTT broker requires client certificate for TLS connections
  - Validate client cert is signed by active CA
  - Map client cert CN to Django user for topic ACL
  - Fallback to username/password auth when client cert not provided

- **Certificate validation & CRL enforcement** (CRITICAL)
  - The broker MUST reject connections from clients presenting:
    - A certificate not signed by the active CA (untrusted issuer)
    - An expired certificate (`not_valid_after` in the past)
    - A revoked certificate (serial number present on the CRL)
  - CRL loaded into the broker's TLS context via `VERIFY_CRL_CHECK_LEAF`
  - CRL refreshed when a certificate is revoked (regenerate + reload)
  - Empty CRL (no revocations) must not block valid clients

- **Tests** — mirror the existing `TestTLSHandshake` tests from `test_pki.py` in the MQTT broker context:
  - TLS listener startup and cert loading from database
  - Valid client cert → MQTT connection accepted, CN maps to correct user
  - Untrusted cert (not signed by CA) → connection refused
  - Expired client cert → connection refused
  - Revoked client cert (on CRL) → connection refused
  - Non-revoked client cert with CRL checking enabled → connection accepted
  - CRL regeneration after revocation → previously-valid cert now rejected

### Phase 7: Advanced Integration
1. **Transition events** — Handle region enter/exit events, store transition history
2. **Waypoints sync** — Connect waypoint storage to command API, allow UI to send waypoints to devices
3. **Friends feature** — Handle card messages (`_type: "card"`), friend relationship model, filtered location broadcasts, friend list API, WebSocket permission filtering

## Test Coverage

- 672 Python tests + 79 TypeScript tests passing
- 85.5% code coverage (**needs improvement to reach 90% target**)
  - Key gaps: `serializers.py` (32%), `mqtt/plugin.py` (77%), `views.py` (85%)
- All pyright checks pass (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- All imports sorted (isort clean)
- All shell scripts pass shellcheck

## Technical Notes

- **Python 3.14 compatibility**: amqtt installed from git, not PyPI
- **MQTT v3.1.1 required**: amqtt only supports protocol level 4 (v3.1.1). OwnTracks Android defaults to v3.1 — reconfigure with `{"_type": "configuration", "mqttProtocolLevel": 4}`. The broker logs a warning when a v3.1 client connects.
- **Django ORM in async**: Use `sync_to_async` wrapper
- **SQLite async tests**: Use `@pytest.mark.django_db(transaction=True)`

## Future Enhancements

- **ACME / Let's Encrypt** — Optional integration for publicly trusted server certificates instead of self-signed CA
